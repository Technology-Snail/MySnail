# MySnail Chrome Extension
This chrome extension, developed by TechnologySnail, allows you to have a **virtual pet snail** that shows up on _every website_ you visit.  You can **_customize_** your snail by changing its colors, size, and speed in the popup menu or in the options page.  The snail continuously crawls across the screen, and comes out of the left side after it has fully disappeared off the right side of the screen.  To hide the snail, simply double-click it.  It will come back when you reload the page or come back to it.

## Future Plans:
The most recent version of MySnail is version 1.8.  Version 1.8 includes:
 - A snail that moves across the screen
 - Customizable colors
 - Customizable size
 - Customizable speed
 - AI-powered color randomizer button
Version 1.9 will introduce:
 - A more aesthetic and convenient popup with the same options
 - More error prevention
Later on, Version 2.0 will bring drastic changes to MySnail, including but not limited to:
 - The snail's ability to speak with a word bubble
 - An options page for more settings beyond the usual found in the popup
 - A way to submit feedback to TechnologySnail (the business that develops MySnail)
 - Checkboxes in the options page to choose what the snail can talk about, including the following options:
  - [x] Low Battery Notification at (customizable value, default = 5)%
  - [x] Notification when newer version of MySnail Chrome extension is available
  - [x] A reminder to drink water, randomly but at approximately 30 minute intervals
  - [x] Friendly reminder to get off screen at certain time, settable between 8:00pm and 10:59pm, defaulting to 10:00pm.  (You can ignore this for five minutes, but the snail will tell you the same thing more sternly five minutes later, and five minutes after that random elements from your screen will start dissappearing... Back to normal at 4:00am.)
  - [x] Fun fact of the day, based on something about the national or international day it is. (Example: Penguin Awareness Day, January 20, may have a fun fact about penguins.)
  - [x] Breaking News! (only good news, no bad)  This can include an epic newly discovered species, a major advancement in technology, a rescue, etc., directly from MySnail News, a source you can trust that won't depress you with bad news.
  - [x] VEAOUI (_Very extreme alerts of utmost importance_)  This does not appear in the checkbox options because it is not optional.  If the world is going to end and there's something you can do about it, your snail will let you know.  Or if a large portion of the world is in great danger due to a massive natural disaster, unlike anything that has occurred in the past 200 years, you will be notified.  The chances that you will ever recieve such a notification are highly unlikely.
