# MySnail-Chrome-Extension
This chrome extension allows you to have a **virtual pet snail** that shows up on _every website_ you visit.  You can **_customize_** your snail by changing its colors, size, and speed in the popup menu or in the options page.  The snail continuously crawls across the screen, and comes out of the left side after it has fully disappeared off the right side of the screen.  To hide the snail, simply double-click it.  It will come back when you reload the page or come back to it.
