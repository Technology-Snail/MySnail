# MySnail-Chrome-Extension
This chrome extension allows you to have a virtual pet snail that shows up on every website you visit.  You can customize your snail by changing its colors and its size in the popup menu or options page.  The snail continuously crawls slowly across the screen, and comes out of the left side after it has fully gone off the right side of the screen.  To hide the snail, simply double-click it.  It will come back when you reload the page or come back to it.
